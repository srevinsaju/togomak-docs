# Getting Started

This tutorial will take less than 2 minutes.

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>
### Installation 
To start off, you need to have `togomak` installed on your system. 
If you haven't installed it yet, check out the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/srevinsaju/togomak/releases)
to find an appropriate version for your system, or you could take a look 
at the [installation](../installation.mdx) too.

### Project Initialization 

Create a new directory for your Togomak project and navigate to it in your terminal.
```bash copy
mkdir my-first-togomak-pipeline
cd my-first-togomak-pipeline
```

### Initializing 
Create a file called `togomak.hcl`, this is a bare minimum pipeline 
that is required for `togomak` to identify it as a valid pipeline. 

```hcl filename="togomak.hcl" copy
togomak {
  version = 2
}
```

You may give a shot executing it now,
```ansi 
[36mINFO[0m[0000] togomak (version=dev)
[36mINFO[0m[0000] [90mtook 0s[0m
```

### Adding stages 
Now, let's create your first Togomak stage. Add the following code to your `togomak.hcl` file:

```hcl filename="togomak.hcl" copy
...

stage "hello_world" {
  script = "echo hello world"
}
```

### Run your pipeline 
You can run your pipeline, by either using `togomak run` or just `togomak`

```bash
togomak
```

### üéâ Congratulations 
You just ran your first togomak pipeline! „ÄΩÔ∏è

So, what's next? If you have another 5 minutes, check out the [tutorial on Stages](./tutorial/running-parallel-stages) to get 
an idea on the parallelism, dependency trees that togomak implements, or check out the use of [Functions](./functions) and 
[Templating](./templating).
