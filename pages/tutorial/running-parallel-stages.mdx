# Tutorial: Running parallel stages

This tutorial will take 5 minutes.

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>
### Installation 
To start off, you need to have `togomak` installed on your system. 
If you haven't installed it yet, check out the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/srevinsaju/togomak/releases)
to find an appropriate version for your system, or you could take a look 
at the [installation](../../installation.mdx) too.

### Project Initialization 

Create a new directory for your Togomak project and navigate to it in your terminal.
```bash copy
mkdir tutorial-parallel-stages
cd tutorial-parallel-stages
```

### Initializing 
Create a file called `togomak.hcl`, this is a bare minimum pipeline 
that is required for `togomak` to identify it as a valid pipeline. 

```hcl filename="togomak.hcl" copy
togomak {
  version = 2
}
```

You may give a shot executing it now,
```ansi 
[36mINFO[0m[0000] togomak (version=dev)
[36mINFO[0m[0000] [90mtook 0s[0m
```

### Adding stages 
Now, let's create your first Togomak stage. Add the following code to your `togomak.hcl` file:

```hcl filename="togomak.hcl" copy

stage "hello_world" {
  script = <<-EOT
  for i in apple orange mango; do 
    echo Hello, World! $i
    sleep 1
  done
  EOT 
}

stage "another_stage" {
  script = <<-EOT
  for i in go rust python; do 
    echo I use $i
    sleep 1
  done
  EOT 
}
```

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  `<<-EOT` is called a Heredoc. If you are not familiar with this syntax, 
  you should definitely check out [Indented Heredocs](/docs/language/expressions/strings#indented-heredocs). It's going to be handy.
</Callout>

### Run your pipeline 
You can run your pipeline, by either using `togomak run` or just `togomak`

```bash
togomak
```

You will notice that, although `another_stage` was defined after `hello_stage`,
both of them runs in parallel. This is because `togomak` is parallel by default.

```ansi 
[36mINFO[0m[0000] togomak (version=dev)
[36mINFO[0m[0000] [[36mstage[0m=hello_world] [+] [34mhello_world[0m

[36mINFO[0m[0003] [90mtook 3.009s[0m
```
You will notice that the entire pipeline execution took 3 seconds.
This is intuitively because both stages which was supposed to take 3 seconds 
ran in parallel.

### Running one stage after another 
Now, we will modify the pipeline such that the stage, `stage.another_stage` runs 
exactly after `stage.hello_world` completes, here is our new pipeline:
```hcl filename="togomak.hcl" copy {15}
togomak {
  version = 2
}

stage "hello_world" {
  script = <<-EOT
  for i in apple orange mango; do 
    echo Hello, World! $i
    sleep 1
  done
  EOT 
}

stage "another_stage" {
  depends_on = [stage.hello_world]
  script = <<-EOT
  for i in go rust python; do 
    echo I use $i
    sleep 1
  done
  EOT 
}
```

Notice the new `depends_on` parameter? This implies that `stage.another_stage` 
depends on the completion of `stage.hello_world`. Let's see how this turns out when we 
run `togomak`. 
```bash 
togomak
```

```ansi
[36mINFO[0m[0000] togomak (version=dev)
[36mINFO[0m[0000] [[36mstage[0m=hello_world] [+] [34mhello_world[0m

[36mINFO[0m[0006] [90mtook 6.02s[0m
```
Yep, now it ran one after another. The time taken, 6 seconds proves it too.

### Run a specific stage 

You can run specific stages. 
```bash
togomak stage.another_stage
```

```ansi 
[36mINFO[0m[0000] togomak (version=dev)
[36mINFO[0m[0000] [[36mstage[0m=hello_world] [+] hello_world (skipped)

```

### 🎉 Congratulations 
You just learnt about how the Togomak dependency resolution and 
default parallelism works. Note that, Togomak uses [Topological Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) 
to figure out the dependency tree.
