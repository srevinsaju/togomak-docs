  `togomak` v2 had a non-backward compatible change in how command line parameters are evaluated. 
  If you are looking for `v1.x` usage spec, see [Usage `v1.x`](./usage_1.x.mdx). 
</Callout>

Togomak includes a query language and a rule engine to choose which stages are run. 

By default, `togomak` runs all stages 
which evaluates their condition `stage.*.if` to 
`true`. By default, all stages evaluate their
condition to true, unless explicitly 
specified. 

To simply run all stages which meet the criteria,
just do
```bash
togomak 
```

If your togomak pipeline lives in a different
directory, you could:
```bash
togomak -C path/to/different/dir
```

## Running specific lifecycles
A [lifecycle](../language/meta-arguments/lifecycles.mdx) is a group of stages, that needs to be run together. 

For example, if you need to run a specific `build` lifecycle, you can use 
```bash 
togomak build
```

You can also specify multiple lifecycles:
```bash
togomak build deploy test
```

The order of the lifecycle specification is irrelevant to togomak. Togomak internally evaluates 
a dependency tree based on actual dependencies. 

By default, unless explicitly specified, `togomak` runs all stages, modules and macros which 
has the `default` lifecycle. If a [`lifecycle` meta-argument](../language/meta-arguments/lifecycles.mdx) has not been specified, 
it may assume the value of `["default"]`. 


<Callout>
  **Example**

  Consider the following togomak configuration 
  ```hcl 
  togomak {
    version = 2
  }

  stage "alice" {
    lifecycle {
      phase = ["default", "deploy"]
    }
    script = "echo hello im default, deploy"
  }

  stage "bob" {
    lifecycle {
      phase = ["deploy"]
    }
    script = "echo hello im deploy"
  }

  stage "eve" {
    lifecycle {
      phase = ["default"]
    }
    script = "echo hello im default"
  }
  ```

  In the above case, lets consider the following possibilities:
  * `togomak` - Just running `togomak` without any arguments, would produce the following outputs 
  ```ansi 
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m togomak (version=dev)
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.bob            [0m   skipped
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.eve            [0m   hello im default

  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m took 2ms
  ```
  It's worthy to note, `stage.bob` was skipped. Only `stage.alice` and `stage.eve` ran. 

  * `togomak default` - Running `togomak` with the `default` lifecycle, would produce the same results 
  as that of `togomak`
  ```ansi
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m togomak (version=dev)
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.bob            [0m   skipped
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.eve            [0m   hello im default

  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m took 2ms
  ```
  Same inference as the previous attempt, `stage.bob` was skipped.

  * `togomak deploy` - We are explicitly requesting only for stages with the `deploy` lifecycle 
  ```ansi
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m togomak (version=dev)
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.eve            [0m   skipped
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.alice          [0m   hello im default, deploy
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.bob            [0m   hello im deploy
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m took 2ms
  ```
  In this scenario, `stage.eve` was skipped, but both `stage.alice` and `stage.bob` ran. 

  * `togomak deploy default` - Now, we are requesting both lifecycles `default` and `deploy` to be run.
  ```ansi
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m togomak (version=dev)
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.eve            [0m   hello im default
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.bob            [0m   hello im deploy
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.alice          [0m   hello im default, deploy
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m took 3ms
  ```
  There you have it, all three, `stage.alice`, `stage.bob` and `stage.eve` ran together.
</Callout>

So, if a specific lifecycle is not part of the `default` lifecycle phase, you can explicitly call it along with `default`
```bash
togomak default deploy
```
The above will run all stages, macros and modules which has the lifecycle `default`, along with that stages, macros and modules which 
has the `deploy` lifecycle. 

However, the following command:
```bash
togomak deploy
```
... will only run the stages, macros and modules which has the lifecycle `deploy`. Anything which belongs to the `default` group will not be 
run, furthermore, if a particular stage has both lifecycle phases `deploy` and `default`, that particular stage would be executed because 
it contains atleast `deploy` which was explicitly requested through command line arguments. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Even when explicitly invoked with lifecycles on togomak, the stage's `if` attribute has a higher precedence. 
  If a stage, such as 
  ```hcl 
  stage "test" {
    lifecycle {
      phases = ["deploy"]
    }
    if = false
  }
  ```
  and when `togomak deploy` is executed, `stage.test` will not be executed because `stage.test.if` evaluated to false. 
  However, you can force it, using `togomak deploy +stage.test`. The `+` operator, forces the stage to run regardless of whether the 
  block has its `if` condition evaluated to `false`
</Callout>

### Running specific stages 

You can request to run specific stages using the `stage.` prefix. This is true for other blocks like `macro.` and `module.` as well.
For example, 
```bash 
togomak stage.alice
```
would only run the specific stage with the id `alice`. Effectively, we call this block overriden. 

You may choose to provide multiple stage names too
```bash
togomak stage.alice stage.bob stage.eve
```

A stage's `if` condition takes precendence over explicitly requested stages. You can force a certain stage to run 
using the `+` prefix operator.


<Callout>
  **Example**

  Consider the following togomak configuration where `github_hook` has an `if` condition set to `togomak.ci`.
  `togomak.ci` is a variable which is `true` when togomak detects that its running on a CI environment. 

  Imagine you are a developer, working on this pipeline:

  ```hcl 
  togomak {
    version = 2
  }

  stage "setup" {
    lifecycle {
      phase = ["default", "deploy"]
    }
    script = "echo im setting things up for you!"
  }

  stage "terraform" {
    depends_on = [stage.docker, stage.setup]
    lifecycle {
      phase = ["deploy"]
    }
    script = "echo terraform apply!"
  }

  stage "github_hook" {
    if = togomak.ci 
    lifecycle {
      phase = ["deploy"]
    }
    script = "echo curl webhook!"
  }

  stage "docker" {
    lifecycle {
      phase = ["default"]
    }
    script = "echo docker build!"
  }
  ```
  Say you have already done the `stage.setup` step multiple times and you don't want to execute it every time you run `togomak deploy`. 
  
  Running `togomak deploy` on this gives the following output:
  ```ansi 
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m togomak (version=dev)
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.docker         [0m   skipped
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.setup          [0m   im setting things up for you!
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.github_hook    [0m   skipped
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.terraform      [0m   terraform apply!
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m took 3ms
  ```

  If you would like to skip, just the `stage.setup` from being executed, you could add it to the exclude list using the `^`, or the negation prefix operator. 

  ```bash
  togomak deploy ^stage.setup
  ```
  This command translates to: "Run everything which belongs to the deploy lifecycle, except the stage called `setup`"
  ```ansi
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m togomak (version=dev)
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.github_hook    [0m   skipped
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.setup          [0m   overridden
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.docker         [0m   skipped
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.terraform      [0m   terraform apply!
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m took 2ms
  ```

  From the above output, you would notice that the `stage.setup` was skipped.

  Now, if you would like to test the `stage.github_hook`?
  
  ```bash
  togomak deploy ^stage.setup +stage.github_hook
  ```
  
  ```ansi 
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m togomak (version=dev)
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.github_hook    [0m   overridden
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.setup          [0m   overridden
  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m [36mstage[0m.docker         [0m   skipped

  [37m0000[0m [36m•[0m took 3ms
  ```
  Yes, the `stage.github_hook` was executed this time despite `if = togomak.ci` was set. This is because the `+` operator ignores the `stage.*.if` condition, which 
  is also the same for the `^` operator. 
</Callout>

### Running all lifecycle phases

There is a magic lifecycle phase which expands to every lifecycle. That is `all`
```bash
togomak all
```
would run all lifecycles including `default`, however `stage.*.if` has higher precendence, so you would like to 
take care of that.
