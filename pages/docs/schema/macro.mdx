# Macro Blocks

Macros are reusable stages. If you would like to reuse the same stage multiple times 
in the same pipeline, with optionally different parameters, `macros` are the right 
thing for you.

You may use `macro` in three ways:
* **Inline stages** (`stage` block): The stage is defined in the macro block, and re-used multiple times
* **External files** (`source` argument): Path to an external single pipeline located on the filesystem, which will
be passed to an internal togomak child process, which will independently run the single file as a separate stage. 
* **Pipeline content** (`files` argument): A map containing files inline, which will be used by togomak, to create 
another child process which will run the contents of the file, as an independant stage. 

Before you decide to use `macro`, you might be interested in seeeing 
[`import` block](./import.md). See also [_What's the difference between macro and import?_](./import.md#whats-the-difference-between-macro-and-import)

### Example usage (Inline stages)

```tf
{{#include ../../../examples/macros/togomak.hcl}}
```

## Argument reference 
* [`stage`](#stage) - The stage that will be reused, optional. Structure [documented below](#stage)
* [`source`](#source) - Path to a different togomak file, which will be recursively invoked.
* [`files`](#files) - a map containing key value pairs of file paths to file content. Map [documented below](#files)

<a href="stage"></a>
The `stage` block supports:
* All features under the [`stage`](../stage.md), except `id`, `name`, `description`
---
<a href="files"></a>
The `files` is a map, which accepts data in the format of key-value pairs, where the "key" is the path to the file 
and the "value" is the content of the file. 

For example,
```hcl
files = {
    "togomak.hcl" = <<-EOT
    togomak {
        version = 2
    }
    stage "hello" {
        script = "echo hello world"
    }
    EOT,
    ...
}
```
