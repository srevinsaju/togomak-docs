# Overview 

## What is a Module?
In Togomak, the module block provides a powerful mechanism for modularizing your configuration and managing complex workflows efficiently. Modules allow you to encapsulate specific functionality, making your configuration more organized and easier to maintain and reuse.

## Syntax 

```hcl 
module "example" {
  source = "./path/to/module"
  variable1 = value1
  variable2 = value2
  # ...
}

```

## Key Concepts 

* **Encapsulation**: Modules encapsulate logic, 
    configurations, and resources, promoting reusability and maintainability.
* **Isolation**: Modules operate independently, 
    avoiding interference with other parts of the configuration.
* **Parameterization**: Modules accept variables, enabling dynamic configuration
    based on different contexts.
* **Source**: Modules can be sourced from local paths or remote repositories, 
    allowing flexibility in code organization.

Modules enhance the modularity and readability of your Togomak configurations, 
enabling you to build sophisticated pipelines with ease. They facilitate 
collaboration, code sharing, and efficient management of complex projects.
