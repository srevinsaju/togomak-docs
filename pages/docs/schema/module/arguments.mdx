# Arguments 

`module` block accepts the following arguments:

* `name` - Optional, provides a human readable display name for the stage 
* `depends_on` - Optional, Defines a list of dependencies that a module needs to wait for before executing. 
This property is optional but crucial for managing the execution order of stages. 
By specifying dependencies, you ensure that certain stages complete before others start. 
Dependencies are referenced using Togomak references, such as `module.<name_of_module>` or `stage.<name_of_stage>`. 
This property is particularly useful when one stage relies on the output or results of another.

* `if` - Optional, defaults to true. Accepts a HCL condition which can determine if the module need to be executed. 
* `for_each` - Optional, Accepts a set or a map of key value pairs which will be used to run the module in parallel. See [`for_each` Meta Argument](../../language/meta-arguments/for_each.mdx) for a detailed explanation and example on how this works. 
* `source` - Required, Accepts a string to a local directory or a remote source. See [`source` Meta Argument](../../language/meta-arguments/source.mdx) for examples and usage. 
* `lifecycle` - Optional, determines the phase of execution of the module. See [`lifecycle` Meta Argument](../../language/meta-arguments/lifecycles.mdx) for examples and usage.

In addition, `module` accepts any arbitary amount of attributes 
which will be passed as variables (or inputs) to the module.

For the module to receive and use the value, it is required to define a 
`variable {}` block which can utilize the value.
