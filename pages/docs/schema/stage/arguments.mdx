# Arguments

## Meta arguments

These arguments are responsible for controlling the flow and providing essential metadata for stages within a Togomak configuration.

- [`name`](./meta.md)
- [`depends_on`](./meta.md)
- [`if`](./meta.md)

## Scripting

These blocks are used to configure and control the execution of shell scripts within a stage, providing options for specifying the script content, shell interpreter, working directory, and script arguments

- [`dir`](./scripting.md)
- [`script`](./scripting.md)
- [`shell`](./scripting.md)
- [`args`](./scripting.md)

## Hooks

These blocks are used to define actions that run immediately before (pre_hook) or after (post_hook) the main stage's execution. They allow you to set up pre-processing or post-processing tasks that are closely tied to the primary stage's operation.

- [`pre_hook`](./hooks.md)
- [`post_hook`](./hooks.md)

## Configuration Blocks

- [`use`](./use.md)
- [`daemon`](./daemon.md)
- [`retry`](./retry.md)
- [`container`](./container.md)
