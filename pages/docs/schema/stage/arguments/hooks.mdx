# Stage Hooks configuration

## `pre_hook`

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Introduced in Togomak v1.5.0
</Callout>

Pre-Hooks are stages that run immediately before the execution of the primary stage.
They are defined using the `pre_hook` block in your Togomak configuration.
Pre-hooks are typically used for tasks that prepare the environment or perform setup
actions necessary for the main stage's success.

- **Execution Order**: Pre-hooks execute before the primary stage.
- **Dependency Relationship**: Pre-hooks can have their dependencies, just like any other stage. This ensures that certain pre-processing tasks are completed before the main stage starts.
- **Use Cases**: Pre-hooks are useful for actions such as environment setup, data preparation, or resource provisioning that need to be in place before the main task begins.
- **Customization**: You can configure pre-hooks with their own parameters, environment variables, and any other relevant settings.

### Example

```hcl showLineNumbers title="togomak.hcl"
togomak {
  version = 2
}

stage "hello" {
  pre_hook {
    stage {
      script = "echo running before the main script in pre-hook"
    }
  }
  script = "echo running in the hello stage"
}
```

## `post_hook`

Post-Hooks are stages that run immediately after the main stage completes, regardless of whether the primary stage succeeded or failed. They are defined using the post_hook block in your Togomak configuration. Post-hooks are commonly used for tasks that clean up resources, generate reports, or trigger notifications after the primary stage's execution.

- **Execution Order**: Post-hooks execute after the primary stage, even if the primary stage fails.
- **Dependency Relationship**: Post-hooks can also have dependencies, ensuring that certain tasks run in a specific order after the main stage.
- **Use Cases**: Post-hooks are useful for actions like logging, resource cleanup, reporting, and notifications, which should occur regardless of the main stage's outcome.
- **Customization:** Similar to pre-hooks, you can configure post-hooks with specific parameters, environment variables, and settings tailored to their

### Example

```hcl showLineNumbers title="togomak.hcl"
togomak {
  version = 2
}

stage "hello" {
  script = "echo running in the hello stage"
  post_hook {
    stage {
      script = "the stage completed with status ${this.status}"
    }
  }
}
```
