# Togomak Block

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Introduced in Togomak v1.0.0
</Callout>

The `togomak {}` block is used by togomak to detect if the `.hcl` file is a togomak pipeline, or a generic HCL file. 
It is required to have atleast one `togomak { ... }` specification in a directory where togomak is executed. 

Here is a sample togomak block:
```hcl filename="togomak.hcl"
togomak {
  version = 2
}
```

## Arguments 
* `version` - A number indicating the version of the configuration file. This version can determine, and enable feature flags 
set within togomak, to execute running specific block types. Supports versions `1`, `2` on v1.x.y, and `2` on v2.x.y 


## Attributes 
In addition to the function of just being able to determine if HCL files are togomak build configurations, `togomak` block 
also exports a set of attributes, which can be used in the pipeline, as listed below:

- `version`: _string_, togomak's version 
- `boot_time` - _string_, time at time.RFC3339
- `boot_time_unix` - _string_, time when the command was executed in UNIX Timestamp
- `pipeline_id` - _string_, A unique UUID generated per execution of a togomak pipeline. This is a UUIDv4 string.
- `ci` - _boolean_, determines if Togomak is running on CI
- `unattended` - _boolean_, determines if Togomak is run in interactive mode, if the user passed `--unattended` flag, or if stdin is attached.

Each of the above may be accessed using `togomak.<attribute>`, as in `togomak.version`, `togomak.ci` and so on.
