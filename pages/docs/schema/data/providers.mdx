# Data Providers

The `data` block receives the data from data providers. There are two kinds of such providers:

- [**Built-in Providers**](./built-in/): Bundled along with `togomak`, as part of the same
  source code.
- [**External Providers**](./contrib.md): These providers are loaded dynamically, likely from
  a third-party registry, and are launched as subprocess and executes with the help of
  [hashicorp/go-plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin).
