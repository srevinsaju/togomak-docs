# `tf` provider

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Introduced in Togomak v1.4.0
</Callout>

The `tf` provider uses Terraform as a data source for your pipeline.
Sometimes, you might want to run a integration test against a private IP
address of a Google Cloud Compute VM - now, using the `data.tf` provider, you
can directly use the Terraform data blocks to get data directly into your
pipeline.

By default, the Terraform Data provider runs a `terraform plan` and an `terraform apply`
only if the plan shows no changes. This means that it can retrieve the data from data blocks.
In certain cases, you might have to create the resource for the data to be available. In those
cases, you may set the `allow_apply` attribute, set to True.

## Requirements

- `terraform`, v1.0.0 or above. Terraform compatible forks like OpenTofu is also allowed.
  `terraform` needs to be available on `$PATH`.

## Example

```hcl filename="togomak.hcl" copy
togomak {
  version = 2
}

data "tf" "this" {
  source = "."
  allow_apply = true
}


stage "hello" {
  script = "echo hello world"
}

stage "delayed" {
  script = "echo Here is a random pet name: ${data.tf.this.random_pet.pet.id}"
}
```

```tf filename="random.tf" copy
resource "random_pet" "pet" {

}
```

## Argument Reference

- [`source`](#source) - (required) The source from where the Terraform files need to be sourced from.
- [`allow_apply`](#allow_apply) - (optional) If set to false, if terraform plan shows infrastructure changes, it will fail.
  Defaults to `false`
- [`vars`](#vars) - (optional) - A list of string key-value pairs which would be passed to Terraform as values to `variable` block.

## Attributes Reference

You would reference the Terraform result like you would do in Terraform, just prefix `data.tf.<id>` before accessing the object.
See [the example](#Example) for a sample usage on the `random_pet` resource.
