In Togomak, a `stage` is like a small, independent task that can perform various operations, such as running scripts, executing Docker containers, setting environment variables, and more. It's a fundamental building block for defining and orchestrating actions within Togomak.

Think of a stage as a unit of work that you can configure and control.
