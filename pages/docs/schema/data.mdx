# Data Blocks

The `data` block allows fetching static data from different sources known 
as `data_providers`. Common providers include examples like environment variables,
file sources, or an external secrets manager, like Hashicorp Vault or Google 
Secret Manager. 

A basic `data` block looks like this:
```hcl 
data "provider_name" "id" {
    ...
    default = "???"
}
```

Here, the data block uses the provider, `provider_name` to retrieve information.
The retrieved value will be stored, and can be accessed `data.provider_name.id.value`.
