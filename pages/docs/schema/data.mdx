# Data Blocks

The `data` block allows fetching static data from different sources known 
as `data_providers`. Common providers include examples like environment variables,
file sources, or an external secrets manager, like Hashicorp Vault or Google 
Secret Manager. 


import { Cards, Card } from 'nextra/components'
 

<Cards>
  <Card title="Providers" href="./data/providers" />
</Cards>

A basic `data` block looks like this:
```hcl
togomak {
  version = 2
} 

data "provider_name" "id" {
    ...
    default = "???"
}
```

Here, the data block uses the provider, `provider_name` to retrieve information.
The retrieved value will be stored, and can be accessed `data.provider_name.id.value`.
