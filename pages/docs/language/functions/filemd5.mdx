# `filemd5` Function

`filemd5` is a variant of [`md5`](/docs/language/functions/md5)
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

This is similar to `md5(file(filename))`, but
because [`file`](/docs/language/functions/file) accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.
