# `filebase64sha512` Function

`filebase64sha512` is a variant of [`base64sha512`](/docs/language/functions/base64sha512)
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

This is similar to `base64sha512(file(filename))`, but
because [`file`](/docs/language/functions/file) accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.
