# Language 

Togomak uses [HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)][hcl] 
for writing the pipeline. HCL gives a very familiar
configuration style as that of Terraform.

Backed up by the popular Terraform repository, you 
get proper typing, functions, variables and powerful 
error reporting, thanks to HCL, which was never possible 
with the previous version (v0) of togomak which used 
YAML.
