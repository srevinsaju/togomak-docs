# Configuration

import { Cards, Card } from 'nextra/components'

In togomak, everything is defined as a "runnable" using an 
HCL block. A standard HCL block looks like this 

```hcl
block_type "id" {
  arg1 = value1
  arg2 = {
    key = "value"
  }

  sub_block {
    id = "value"
  }
}
```
For a detailed understanding of togomak HCL syntax, we recommend 
[**🔗 Terraform's Guide to HCL Syntax**](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax)

Multiple blocks can be placed in different files under the same directory, or 
could be [imported](./schema/import). Here are the supported togomak blocks: 


<Cards>
  <Card title="🏃 Stage" href="./schema/stage" />
  <Card title="📚 Data" href="./schema/data" />
  <Card title="📜 Macro" href="./schema/macro" />
  <Card title="🚛 Import" href="./schema/import" />

  <Card title="📍 Locals" href="./schema/locals" />

  <Card title="🧲 Togomak" href="./schema/togomak" />
</Cards>
