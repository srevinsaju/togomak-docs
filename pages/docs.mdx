**Schema** helps to understand the different blocks 
that will help you write your orchestration pipeline. 
This includes the different arguments (and parameters) which 
will help to customize your pipelines.

**Language** defines features such as `for` loop support,
expressions, type system and a list of supported functions that 
you may use in most blocks as defined in [schema](./docs/schema).

The **Command Line Usage** explains how to run specific 
[stages](./docs/schema/stage).
